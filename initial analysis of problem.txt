----------API----------

Python3

Flask or Falcon?
Flask:
-more popular
-good start
-they talked about it in the talk we had

Falcon:
-minimalist library for web APIs
-REST
-high level of customization

will use FLASK
the aplication uses the simple crud methods only, non customization necessary

----------DOCKER----------

never used, most difficult part, will have to learn

----------POSTGRESQL----------

Create table
easy table

id int
id_cliente int
angel varchar
polo varchar:
    polo_state
    polo_city
data_limite date
data de atendimento is datetime

----------CSV2POSTGRESQL----------

date from data_limite in wrong format
dd/mm/aaaa
should be aaaa-mm-dd
fix it first
regex

take state and city as different things
better filtering

create python script to read csv and send it through the api method POST
or send it through postgresql lib in python?

----------OBS----------

How did they chose the names?
mix of my name and their names?
lots of xara, virgilio

----------TODO----------

1)DOCKER

2)Create API - ok
2)Create database - ok

3)feed postgree - create script to feed

4)Create dashboard with metabase

5)Tests
